* Introduction

** Introduction

*** Introduction

- The topic of this talk: using quantitative syntactic criteria to assign dates to texts

*** Background: texts not manuscripts

- Manuscripts (physical artifacts) are best dated using non-linguistic methods
  - Explicit dates
  - Biographical details of known authors/scribes
  - References to historical events, etc.
- Texts are abstract objects
  - Assumed: composed by a single author at a specific time in a coherent style/dialect
  - Passed down through one or more MS witnesses, not necessarily contemporaneous with the textʼs composition

*** Background: Old English and Beowulf

- Early 700s – 1100s
- Surviving prose texts: sermons and religious writing, medical treatises, translations of Latin texts
  - ca. 1M words
- Beowulf: long poem (3000 l.)
  - Single MS dated ca. 1000
  - Meter, phonology, morphology, etc. suggest earlier date, perhaps 8th century
  - Non-linguistic evidence tends to favor this conclusion as well, though some have argued that the text date = MS date
    - (Drout et al. 2014 Give the People What They Want: Historiography and Rhetorical History of the Dating of Beowulf Controversy)

*** Background: OE resources

- York Corpus of Old English (YCOE)
- Manual morphological analysis and syntactic parse for most extant OE prose, plus Beowulf (but not many other poems)
- Choices made by the YCOE team
  - Which MS/witness of a text to prefer
  - What counts as a “text”

* Syntactic dating I: Beowulf

** Background

*** Why syntactic dating

- Linguistic evidence used for OE text dating has not been syntactic
- Experience in OE and other domains indicates that parsed corpora can complement other types of historical linguistic inquiry
  - Consistency
  - Replicability
  - Quickness

*** Syntactic dating: the basic premises

- Syntactic changes have been observed to follow an S-shaped logistic curve (Bailey 1973, Kroch 1989)
- In an ideal world, we can use the shape of such a curve to identify when a text was composed

1. Establish black curve on the basis of known-date texts
2. Measure unknown text, see green level of phenomenon of interest
3. From blue point, follow red line to x-axis; date = 925

*** Syntactic dating of OE: criteria

- In order to carry out such an exercise, we need to identify syntactic changes that take place in OE
  - IP: head-final \to head-initial
  - VP: head-final \to head-initial
  - V-to-C movement: lost in main clause declaratives
  - Scrambling of pronoun objects: lost
  - Relative clauses: move from demonstrative-headed to complementizer-headed
  - Noun-Genitive order: becomes fixed
  - Topicalization: lost
  - Negative Concord: lost
  - Expletive subjects: covert \to overt
- Not necessary for criteria to go 0 \to 100 over the time period of interest
  - IP headedness change: basically completed (>80%) by beginning of OE, except in subordinate clauses
  - Negative concord: ongoing in ME, EME (and PDE...)

** Syntactic dating of Beowulf
*** Syntactic dating of Beowulf: introduction

- We attempted to use this methodology to assign a date to Beowulf
- We identified four conditions that our criteria must fulfill
  1. The criterion must show a consistent trend over the OE period
  2. There must be enough data in Beowulf to evaluate the criterion
  3. The value in Beowulf must fall within a plausible interval, based on the prose texts
  4. The criterion must not systematically differ between prose and poetic texts

*** Syntactic dating of Beowulf: conclusions

- Our results agree with the linguistic consensus, and the non-linguistic majority: Beowulf was composed early in the OE period, in the 8th or early 9th century

#+beamer: \pause

- But: we have not used terribly sophisticated quantitative analysis to reach this conclusion
- But: we have not quantified our uncertainty

* Syntactic dating II: methods

** Statistical considerations

*** Background

- We want to design a procedure for assigning dates to texts
- For this purpose, texts of unknown date are the least interesting of all!
  - Assigning these texts a date is the last thing weʼll do before turning out the lights on this project
  - Because: it doesnʼt help our method get any better
- Our goal: devise a method that is good at assigning dates to texts whose dates we already know
  - We know itʼs a good method because we already know the answers

*** Cross-validation

- *Crossvalidation* is just the statisticianʼs name for doing exactly this
- Take the set of texts whose dates we know and split them up into two groups
  - Training set: data points we use to construct our dating models
  - Testing set: data points we use to test the model
  - We pretend we donʼt know the dates of the texts in the testing set
- Because we are testing, developing, and comparing multiple models, we chose to use an 80/20 training/testing split, consistent across all the models we fit
  - 23 texts in training sample, 6 in testing
- We also hand selected the test set members to be a representative sample (because random sampling over the small population of OE texts might produce skewed results)

** Model 1: variable selection

*** Variable selection

- In this kind of syntactic dating, we have N predictors, all of which are moving in the same direction
- A bad situation for a statistical model to be in
  - Which movements are relevant?  Which are redundant?
  - Lots of degrees of freedom \to lots of opportunities to overfit
- The solution to problems of this type is *variable selection*

*** Variable selection: elastic net

- Problem: “runaway” coefficients
  - If other predictors adequately describe the data, the left-over predictors might assume very large values, values with the wrong sign, etc.
  - Solution: ridge regression
    - “make regression coefficients small”
- Problem: redundant information
  - For example, multiple measures of the same phenomenon
  - Solution: lasso regression
    - “zero out some coefficients”
- Elastic net regression: the best of both worlds
  - \alpha ranges from 0 to 1
  - \alpha = 0 is ridge regression, \alpha = 1 is lasso

** Model 2: quantification of uncertainty

*** Quantification of uncertainty

- None of the models weʼve used so far give us a quantification of uncertainty
- How sure are we that our estimate is correct?
  - (Before we peek at the true answer)
- Bayesian estimation provides a framework for quantification of uncertainty
  - “Everything is a probability distribution”

*** Examples of Bayesian modeling

- Ordinary regression
  - $y = \beta x + \epsilon$
  - $\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$
  - $\beta \sim \ldots$ \rightarrow what we usually care about
- “Multilevel” modeling
  - $y = \beta x + \beta_{text} i_{text} + \epsilon$
  - $\beta_{text} \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ \rightarrow often a nuisance variable
- Our model
  - Ordinary regression plus...
  - $y_{unknown} = \beta x_{unknown} + \epsilon$
  - Jointly estimate \beta and x_{unknown}
  - Weʼre not particularly concerned with \beta, but we get x_{unknown} as a distribution

*** Techniques for Bayesian modeling

- Bayesian modeling doesnʼt come with ready-made modeling packages
  - You write your own model in a special programming language
- Fitting a Bayesian model requires lots of computational power
  - (As compared to traditional models; in absolute terms it may not amount to much with data of this size)
- Iʼve used the STAN package, and these models are available online
  - https://github.com/uoy-linguistics/dating-beowulf-2015/blob/97cdaec5e4f4c2afef5228477008710e8fc3e584/analyses/analyses-new.org#stan

- The results are good (ever so slightly better than the elastic net model)
- But the uncertainty is not well-quantified
  - Only 1/6 texts has the actual date within the 95% CI

*** Discussion

- In a sense we expect this: we havenʼt modeled the fact that individual texts are idiosyncratic
  - The intuition behind “ordinary” hierarchical regression models
  - My attempts to add this to the Bayesian model have so far not worked
- This model doesnʼt do any variable selection – perhaps adding elastic net properties to it could improve it
- The quantification of uncertainty element of the modeling picture isnʼt yet complete, but I regard it as the most promising area for development

*** Just for fun

- What happens if we apply the Bayesian model to Beowulf?

| Model             | Predicted | CI      |
|-------------------+-----------+---------|
| All criteria      |       903 | 889–916 |
| Remove IS-related |       862 | 847–877 |

- Information structure-related criteria = Topicalization \times 4, V-to-C
- Earliest text in the training sample is 859
  - The date is not as early as we might otherwise believe, but we have pushed it back as far as our data goes

* Conclusion

** Conclusion

*** Conclusion

- In our tests, syntactic dating gives reliable results, even on the basis of relatively few texts (2 dozen)
- Syntactic dating relies on identifying syntactic changes which are candidates for dating criteria
  - Parsed corpora make this much easier: my co-authors had the idea of exploring NC in OE, which was not previously well-studied but wound up being useful for us
- Other criteria could be used instead of/in addition to syntactic ones
  - e.g. phonological changes, though beware dialect variation
- Thereʼs still room to improve the statistical underpinnings of these types of models, especially at the Bayesian end of the spectrum

Modeling strategy:

- for each feature, fit a linear model
- get the predictions of all models for each text
- fit a model which computes an average of these predictions, weighted
  by sqrt(n) for the underlying probability calculation (because of
  binomial sampling), and which also fits an overall set of weights.
- apply this model to beowulf
  - output: date estimate
  - output: distribution of individual feature date estimates
    (uncertainty/consistency)

open questions: can the individual feature models be fit to the same
dataset that we use to balance the features?  or does this lead to
overfitting?

there must be a more principled way of doing this...
